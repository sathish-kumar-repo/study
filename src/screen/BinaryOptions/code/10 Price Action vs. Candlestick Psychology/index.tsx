      <Para>
        Price action and candlestick psychology are closely related, but they
        focus on different aspects of market behavior. Let's break them down:

      <H1>Price Action</H1>

              <span>
                Price action refers to the movement of price over time without
                relying on indicators
              </span>
            ),
          },

                It involves analyzing{" "}
                <b>
                  chart patterns, support & resistance, trendlines, breakouts,
                  and market structure
                </b>{" "}
                to make trading decisions.

            text: (

                Price action traders focus on{" "}
                <b>
                  market structure (higher highs, lower lows), momentum,
                  liquidity zones, and institutional moves

                rather than just individual candlesticks.

          {
            text: (
              <span>
                Example: If price forms a <b>double bottom at strong support</b>
                , a price action trader looks for confirmation (higher highs
                forming) before entering a buy trade.

                Candlestick psychology focuses on the{" "}
                <b>story behind each candlestick</b> â€” who is in control (buyers
                or sellers) and what emotions are driving the price.

                Example: A <b>long lower wick on a bullish candle at support</b>
                shows rejection of lower prices, indicating buyers are stepping
                in.
