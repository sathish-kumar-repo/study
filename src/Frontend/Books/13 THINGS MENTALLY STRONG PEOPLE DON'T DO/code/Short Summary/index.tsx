      <Para>
        Mentally strong people don’t sit around feeling sorry about their

        else power over them. They don’t say things like, “My boss makes me feel

        they’ve learned from it. However, they don’t constantly relive bad

        They accept responsibility for their behavior and learn from their past
        mistakes. As a result, they don’t keep repeating those mistakes over and
        over. Instead, they move on and make better decisions in the future.

        success in life. They don’t grow jealous or feel cheated when others
