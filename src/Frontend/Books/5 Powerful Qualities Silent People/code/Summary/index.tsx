        they direct energy to meaningful tasks.

        people are keen observers. They see beyond words into <em>tone</em>,{" "}
        <em>body language</em>, and <em>unspoken motives</em>. In their
        quietness, they detect lies, manipulation, and authenticity.

        attention. They don’t flaunt their plans or broadcast their moves. They
        let <em>results</em> do the talking. A quiet achiever earns long-term
        respect, unlike loud individuals who fail to deliver.

        words, emotions, and environment. In a world where everyone wants to be
        heard, the truly powerful are those who know <em>when to be silent</em>.
