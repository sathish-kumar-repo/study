      <Para>
        Morgan Houselâ€™s <em>Same as Ever</em> shares timeless lessons about how
        people think and behave. Even though the world keeps changing, our
        emotionsâ€”like fear, greed, and hopeâ€”stay the same. This book helps us
        understand these patterns so we can make smarter choices with money,
        risk, time, and life.
      </Para>

      <H1>ðŸŒŸ Core Premise</H1>
      <Para>
        Technology and trends changeâ€”but human behavior doesnâ€™t. People keep
        making the same mistakes and following the same emotions. If you
        understand how people think, youâ€™ll always have an advantage.
