      <Title>The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel - Detailed Summary</Title>

      <H1>Introduction: Money is Behavior, Not Math 🤯</H1>
      <Para>
        Morgan Housel begins by highlighting the fundamental truth: financial
        success is more about how you behave than how intelligent you are.
        People with no formal financial education can build great wealth with
        good habits, while highly intelligent people can struggle financially if
        their behavior is poor. The book dives into the psychology behind
        money—fear, greed, pride, envy, and personal experiences—and how these
        shape our financial choices.
