      <Title>The Psychology of Money</Title>

      <H1>1. No One’s Crazy</H1>
      <Para>
        Everyone makes financial decisions based on their life experiences.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        A person who’s seen poverty might save aggressively, while someone from
        wealth might take bigger risks.
      </Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Don’t judge others’ money behavior—they may
        have a completely different context.
      </Quote>

      <H1>2. Luck & Risk</H1>
      <Para>Success ≠ skill alone. Luck plays a role.</Para>
      <Para>Failure ≠ stupidity. Risk happens.</Para>
      <Para>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Bill Gates succeeded due to timing, access to
        a computer at a rare school, and skill.
      </Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Be humble when successful and empathetic
        when others fail.
      </Quote>

      <H1>3. Never Enough</H1>
      <Para>Some people never feel satisfied, even after immense wealth.</Para>
      <Para>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Bernie Madoff risked everything for more, lost
        it all.
      </Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Define “enough” and stick to it. Avoid
        comparison traps.
      </Quote>

      <H1>4. Compounding – The 8th Wonder</H1>
      <Para>Small gains over long time = massive results.</Para>
      <Para>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Warren Buffett started early and kept going.
        His wealth multiplied later in life.
      </Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Start early. Stay patient. Time &gt; timing.
      </Quote>

      <H1>5. Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy</H1>
      <Para>Getting rich = taking risk.</Para>
      <Para>Staying rich = humility, frugality, and protection.</Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Build wealth slow, protect it fast.
      </Quote>

      <H1>6. Tails Drive Everything</H1>
      <Para>A few rare events (tail events) account for most success.</Para>
      <Para>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Amazon’s AWS changed their entire financial
        story.
      </Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Be consistent, survive long enough to catch
        your “tail event.”
      </Quote>

      <H1>7. Freedom = Wealth</H1>
      <Para>Real wealth = control over your time.</Para>
      <Para>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Even a lower-paid freelancer can be wealthier
        than a stressed executive.
      </Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Design your life to maximize freedom, not
        status.
      </Quote>

      <H1>8. Man in the Car Paradox</H1>
      <Para>
        We think others admire our wealth, but they imagine themselves in our
        place.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        <strong>Example:</strong> A fancy car doesn’t make people admire
        you—they just want the car.
      </Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Impressing others is a losing game. Seek
        respect, not attention.
      </Quote>

      <H1>9. Wealth Is What You Don’t See</H1>
      <Para>
        Flashy spending ≠ rich. True wealth is hidden (savings, investments).
      </Para>
      <Para>
        <strong>Example:</strong> A person with designer clothes might be in
        debt; a modest neighbor might be a millionaire.
      </Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Save more. Spend less. Don’t show off.
      </Quote>

      <H1>10. Save Money</H1>
      <Para>Income matters. But savings matter more.</Para>
      <Para>Savings = security, flexibility, and opportunity.</Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Save like your future depends on it—because
        it does.
      </Quote>

      <H1>11. Reasonable &gt; Rational</H1>
      <Para>
        You don’t need perfect logic. You need a plan you’ll stick to.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Paying off low-interest debt may not be
        “smart,” but it brings peace of mind.
      </Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Choose the financial path you can follow
        consistently.
      </Quote>

      <H1>12. Surprise! The World is Unpredictable</H1>
      <Para>
        History is shaped by black swan events—pandemics, crashes, wars.
      </Para>
      <Para>Don’t rely on perfect predictions.</Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Build plans with flexibility. Expect the
        unexpected.
      </Quote>

      <H1>13. Room for Error</H1>
      <Para>Always leave space for mistakes, losses, and shocks.</Para>
      <Para>Have an emergency fund, avoid over-leverage.</Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Don’t stretch too thin. Survival matters
        more than optimization.
      </Quote>

      <H1>14. You’ll Change</H1>
      <Para>Your goals and desires will change as you grow.</Para>
      <Para>
        <strong>Example:</strong> You might value adventure now, but later value
        security or family.
      </Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Be flexible. Avoid permanent decisions on
        temporary feelings.
      </Quote>

      <H1>15. Nothing is Free</H1>
      <Para>
        Every reward has a cost—usually emotional (fear, doubt, boredom).
      </Para>
      <Para>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Long-term investors endure crashes and fear.
      </Para>
      <Quote>

        the cost of wealth.
      </Quote>

      <H1>16. You & Me</H1>
      <Para>Others are playing different financial games.</Para>
      <Para>

        planning for 30 years.

        and time horizon.
      </Quote>

      <H1>17. Pessimism Sounds Smart</H1>
      <Para>
        Negativity sells. Optimism is quieter but more accurate over time.
      </Para>
      <Para>The world keeps improving despite setbacks.</Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Stay rational. Don’t let fear-based news
        affect your long-term plan.
      </Quote>

      <H1>18. People Believe Anything in Crisis</H1>
      <Para>
        Fear distorts thinking. People believe scams, conspiracies, and rumors
        when scared.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Stock market crashes trigger irrational panic
        selling.
      </Para>
      <Quote>
        🔑 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Stay grounded. Filter information carefully
        during emotional times.
