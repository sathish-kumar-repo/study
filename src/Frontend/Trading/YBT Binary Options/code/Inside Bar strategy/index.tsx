      <H3>Important Note</H3>
      <Para>
        This strategy is designed for live market conditions and is not
        recommended for OTC (Over The Counter) markets.
      </Para>

      <Note>
        When trading on a 1-minute chart, perform your analysis using a 2-minute
        timeframe. Similarly, for a 2-minute trade, analyze using a 3-minute or
        ideally a 4-minute chart.
        <Quote>
          A 4-minute chart provides optimal analysis, but platforms like Quotex
          may not support this timeframe.

            below the initial seller candleâ€™s close.
          </>,
          <>
            <HL>However:</HL> You may take an entry if the new seller candle
            closes just below the initial closing price and your setup is still
            valid.

      <Para>
        In some cases, the bullish candle may appear after one or two error
        candles. Stay patient and observe closely.

      <Note>
        Always analyze using a 2-minute chart and execute your entry on a
        1-minute trade. If the first attempt results in a loss, consider using a
        martingale approach. This is a <HL>rare but highly accurate pattern</HL>
        , typically appearing once every 30 minutes.
